# Hypertrophy Tracker – Project Identity

## Vision
The Hypertrophy Tracker is designed to be the most **streamlined, distraction-free workout companion**, optimized specifically for **progressive hypertrophy training**.  
The goal is to help lifters track every workout with minimal friction while the app handles the intelligence behind the scenes.

## Core Purpose
To make hypertrophy‑focused training simple, consistent, and adaptive by:
- Logging workouts quickly and intuitively.
- Automatically determining next‑session weight targets (progressive overload).
- Providing clear insight into progress over time (strength, volume, consistency).
- Keeping the UI minimal so lifters stay focused during training.

## High‑Level Features
### 1. **Workout Logging**
- Start a workout and log sets with reps, weight, and optional RPE.
- Switch between exercises quickly.
- Handle incomplete workouts intelligently (suggest weight next time).

### 2. **Hypertrophy Engine**
Behind the scenes:
- Track per‑exercise volume, weight history, weekly sets.
- Recommend weight jumps, deloads, or repeat loads depending on performance.
- Suggest exercise ordering or swaps (future).

### 3. **Progression Tab**
A dedicated tab that visualizes:
- Strength trends per exercise  
- Weekly hypertrophy volume  
- Best sets, tonnage, estimated 1RM  
- Consistency streaks  
- Muscle‑group breakdowns

### 4. **Settings Tab**
Includes:
- Units (kg/lb)
- Customize exercise list
- Manage split days
- Backup/sync options (future)
- Personal preferences for progression rules

## Identity Summary
The app's identity is **simple logging + intelligent progression + clear progress insights**, all while remaining **lightweight, offline‑capable, and fast**.
